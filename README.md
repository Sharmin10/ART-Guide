# ART-Guide

## Requirements

To use the ART-Guide app, you will need an Android phone that is compatible with ARCore. ARCore is Google's platform for building augmented reality experiences, and not all Android devices support it.

You can check if your device is compatible with ARCore by visiting the [official list of supported devices](https://developers.google.com/ar/devices). If your device is not listed, it may not be able to run the AR features of the app.


## Installation

To install the ART-Guide app on your Android device, follow these steps:

1. Download the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in Android Studio.
3. Build and run the project on your Android device.

## Running the App

### On a Physical Android Device

To experience the full functionality of the ART-Guide app, it is recommended to download and install the app on a physical Android device. This is because the app utilizes augmented reality (AR) features, which are not fully supported on emulated devices.

You can follow these steps to download and install the app on your Android device:

1. Connect your Android device to your computer using a USB cable.
2. Enable USB debugging on your Android device. You can find instructions on how to do this in the [Android Developer documentation](https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/dev-options).
3. Once your device is connected and USB debugging is enabled, build the ART-Guide app using Android Studio and run it on your device.
4. The app will be installed on your device, and you can launch it to explore the galleries and enjoy the AR features.

### On an Emulator

While it's possible to run the ART-Guide app on an emulator, please note that the AR features may not function as expected. Emulated devices do not fully support ARCore, the platform required for AR functionality. As a result, some features may be limited or unavailable on emulated devices.

If you still wish to run the app on an emulator for testing purposes, you can follow the instructions provided in the [Android Studio documentation](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator).
